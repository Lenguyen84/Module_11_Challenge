Data Analysis: On Mars, the third month generally has the coldest minimum temperatures, while the eighth month is the warmest. Despite this, temperatures remain extremely cold by human standards. Atmospheric pressure tends to be lowest in the sixth month and highest in the ninth. The interval between pressure peaks is approximately 675 days, which aligns closely with the Martian year of about 687 Earth days, as confirmed by an internet search.
